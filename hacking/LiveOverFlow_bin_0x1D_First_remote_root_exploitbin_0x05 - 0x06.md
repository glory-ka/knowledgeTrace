### __gdb__
```text
gdb file_ELF

(gdb) disassemble main			: dump the assembly code.
(gdb) set disassembly-flavor intel	: change the type to Intel for better and easier analysis.

jne : jump not equal
rip : instuction pointer

(gdb) break *main			: sete break point
(gdb) run
(gdb) info register			: diplay information about the registers
(gdb) si				: step one instruction (step into)
(gdb) ni				: next instruction     (step over)
(gdb) break *address			: break at the specified address
(gdb) continue				: run until the next break point

EAX refers to the first part of the 32-bit RAX register. 

(gdb) set $eax=0
```

___

**Alternative to GDB**

```bash
# Show the file in hexadecimal format or annotation.
hexdump -C file_ELF	

strings file_EFL
```
___

### __objdump__

**objdump** output lot more information than the gdb disassemble command. So it is best to pipe the data in 'less'
```bash
~$ objdump -x file_ELF | less # -x prints all the file headers.
```

One spot to check is the **.text section**. This will only store the address of the section where the code lives.
The first bytes give the size of the code section, then the begining address.
The code doesn't start at the beginning adddress but somewhere in (begin_add + size_text).

The other spot to check is the **.rodata** which is the read only section. (contains strings for example).
Like we said above, the first bytes give the size of the block and the second the starting address.

**PAY ATTENTION TO THE BOUNDDARIES WHEN LOOKING AT REGISTER TO SEE IF THE ADDRESS IS INSIDE THE section BLOCK.**

```bash
# This prints the element stored in the register
(gdb) x/s register_Address

# print out Assembly code of the ELF loaded with extra information from the compiler (gcc)
~$ objdump -d file_ELF
```

### __TRACE AND SYSTEMCALL__

**SYSTEMCALLS** are functions such as **WRITE**(to write on the stdout), **EXECVE**(to execute the EFL file)
Most functions we use in c are from the **libc** library (printf, etc.) which are wrapper around **SYSTEMCALLS** LINUX provides.

```text
strace			       : Trace SYSTEMCALL functions and SIGNAL the program used since execution.
ltrace			       : Trace LIBRARY functions which means it does not care about the SYSTEMCALL these functions make.
```
...

```bash
~$ strace ./file_ELF
~$ ltrace ./file_ELF
```

### ___RADARE2__

**Clone Git repertory**
```bash
~$ git clone https://github.com/radare/radare2.git
```

**Install radare2**
```bash
~$ ./sys/install.sh
```

**Run radare2**
```bash
~$ r2 file_ELF
```
...

```text
[address_of_text_segment]>	: show up at the begining after a ELF is run with Radare.
[address] > aaa			: Automtically Analyse and Autoname functions
[address] > afl			: print all funtions Radare found.
[address] > ?			: print lists of information about characters to use. 
[address] > a?			: {a} performs Analysis of code, {?} show possible options.
[address] > af?			: {?} show all possible combination that follows {af}.
```
##### __if a command is incomplete, Radare outputs choice of potential commands.__

```bash
[address] > s s			: Incomplete command. Print a list of possible command.
[address] > s sym.main		: {s} seek and move current address to location of a function, {sym.main} function 'main'.
[main_address] pdf		: print disassembly of the current function.
[main_address] VV		: Enter View Mode.
```

### __VISUAL MODE__

```text
TAB + SHIFT		: Select other blocks.
SHIFT + hjkl	: Move the selected block.
P				: Cycle through different block representation.
?				: Display help.
```
___

### __DEBUG WITH RADARE__

**Enter Radare for debugging**
~$ r2 -d file_ELF

```text
[address] s sym.		: Print possible choice to complete the command.
[address] s sym.main		: (seek main) change address to main function.
[main_address]			: Analyse All with 'aaa'.
[main_address] pdf		: Print disassembly.
[main_address] db main_address 	: Place a break at the beginning.
[main_address] VV		: Enter View Mode
```

###### __VV VISUAL MODE__

Enter command mode, like in Vim, with colomn **(:)**.

```bash
:> dc 		: Continue the program after break point reached.
s		: Step instructions.
SHIFT + s	: Step over instructions.
```

**The "INSTRUCTION POINTER [rip:]" moves and show the where 'rip:' currently ponts to.**
