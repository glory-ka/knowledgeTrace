#### __2bit COMPILER__

When compiling (gcc) with the flage -m32 on a 64bit machine, install the 32bit libray first:
sudo apt-get install libc6-dev-i386



#### __STRIPPED BINARY__

**stripped binary** It's a binary where symbol information of functions and variables have been removed. For example "disas main" won't work since main does not exit in the binary.

With this type of binary use **x/i** to examine the code and get an address with **info files**.

**Info files** shows the section of the file, specifially, we want the **.text section** address where the code lives. But at the beginning, you might start at an address called **entry point** which might be insdide the **.text section()**.

```bash
(gdb) info files
(gdb) x/20i address
```

The **'main'** function, at the begining of the code, actually calls **_libc_start_main** in **libc** and passes its address as argument.
So, by tracking the call for **_libc_start_main** we can find the address where the program starts.
WE can do that by setting a **PENDING breakpoint** which triggers when the **libc** function is called and the name is detected.

```bash
# trigger when the library is called and its code is loaded into the executable binary. 
break __libc_start_main
```
